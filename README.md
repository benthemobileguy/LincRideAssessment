# LincRide

A modern Android ride-sharing application built with Jetpack Compose, featuring real-time ride simulation, interactive maps, and a comprehensive modal system for driver-passenger interactions.

## Features

- Interactive Maps Integration - Google Maps with real-time car tracking and route visualization
- Ride Simulation Engine - Complete ride lifecycle from pickup to drop-off with animated progress
- Modern Modal System - Consistent bottom sheet modals for all ride states
- Professional UI/UX - SF Pro Display typography, Material 3 design system
- Real-time Progress Tracking - Animated progress bars with car movement
- Multi-passenger Support - Handle multiple passengers with individual avatars and route stops
- Trip Analytics - Earnings tracking, CO₂ savings calculation, passenger ratings

## Architecture

Built using modern Android development practices:

- Jetpack Compose for declarative UI
- Material 3 design system with custom LincRide theme
- Modular architecture with feature-based modules
- Clean Architecture principles with domain/data/presentation layers
- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations

## UI States

The app simulates a complete ride-sharing experience with the following modal states:

1. Get to Pickup - Navigate to passenger location with progress tracking
2. Pickup Confirmation - Swipeable interface for "Picked up" vs "Didn't show"
3. Heading to Drop-off - Route visualization with multiple passenger stops
4. Trip Ended - Earnings summary, passenger rating, and CO₂ impact

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- Android SDK 34
- Kotlin 1.9.0+
- Google Maps API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LincRide.git
   cd LincRide
   ```

2. **Set up Google Maps API Key**
   
   Create `local.properties` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.template local.properties
   ```
   
   Edit `local.properties` and add the API key:
   ```properties
   # Location of the SDK. This is only used by Gradle.
   sdk.dir=/Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
   
   # Google Maps API Key
   MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyB2vUCvcTcnoeOykj5nuZQwDXZFA5_3oJA
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   
   Or open in Android Studio and run the `app` module.

### API Key Security

- The `local.properties` file is automatically ignored by git
- Never commit your API key to version control
- For production builds, use secure CI/CD environment variables

## Design System

### Typography
- Primary Font: SF Pro Display (Light, Regular, Medium, Bold)
- Material 3 Typography with custom LincRide styles
- Consistent sizing: 11sp, 12sp, 14sp, 16sp, 18sp hierarchy

### Colors
- Primary: LincGreen (#00C853)
- Secondary: LincBlue (#2C75FF)  
- Background: PickupBackground (#EAFFF6)
- Route Colors: StopGreen (#4A941C), StopOrange (#D27B0D)

### Components
- Reusable Modal System with consistent patterns
- Custom Progress Bars with car animation
- Professional Avatar System with real images
- Route Visualization with dots, lines, and color coding

## Development

### Key Components

- BottomSheetContainer: Reusable modal wrapper with animations
- GradientProgressBarWithCar: Animated progress tracking
- RouteVisualization: Multi-stop route display with passenger avatars
- PassengerInfoCard: Consistent passenger information layout

### Modal System
All modals follow a consistent pattern:
- "Smart" composables handle logic and state
- "Dumb" composables focus on UI display only
- Reusable components for consistency
- Material 3 typography for SF Pro Display integration

## Building for Production
